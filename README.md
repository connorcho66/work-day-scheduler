# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

A simple website that allows users to save events by hourly from 8AM to 5PM. The browser uses dayjs to log the time and the events that is saved are saved locally. As the time goes, each hour that passes, are greyed out, current hour will be red, and future hours are green.
